'),(3,4,9780826401076,'mumu','For one night reading.','Stanislaw Lem outdoes Philip K. Dick on the latters home territory. If reading this doesnt make you doubt the solidity of the world for at least a moment or two, you are an enviably secure person. Im afraid I still feel apprehensive any time I notice Im inexplicably out of breath after taking an elevator. Luckily that doesnt happen very often.'),(4,3,9781613739266,'mumu','Welcome mental bleach','This is a story with no clear direction or a proper progressing narrative, just a slice of magical work life, where horrific near-cataclysms are as common as the usual piddling office disputes. Fun, funny, very imaginative, occasionally gross and all in all a superb read. Definitely, some welcome mental bleach if youve just finished the Strugatskys other seminal and considerably more bleak work, Roadside Picnic.'),(5,2,9782207248539,'mumu','Not much fun.','I rate books based on my enjoyment and while this was a very interesting take on the whole \"alien/first contact\" I cant say I had a lot of fun reading it.\r\n\r\nI do recommend it if you love that premise and are intrigued about a sentient ocean but it wont be for everyone!'),(6,5,9788071453611,'mumu','I loved this book! ','It turned out to be one of those easy-to-read stories that leave you thinking, and thinking, and thinking. The science fiction aspect of the plot is not important at all. It is the impact of power, knowledge, and ritual on every single individual that made me want to restart reading it as soon as I finished. I absolutely adore the creation of Bokononism and the development of a new language to suit the needs of the religion-in-the-making.'),(7,4,9788071453611,'herasim','Why not to read it?','When he embarks on a project to write a book about the creators of the atomic bomb, Jonah has no idea what hes going to unearth: Dr Felix Hoenikker and Ice-Nine, a substance that will instantly freeze any water it comes into contact with into more Ice-Nine, a substance capable of destroying all life on earth. Can Jonah find the missing Hoenikker children and secure their chips of Ice-Nine to safeguard the world?'),(8,5,9782207248539,'herasim','You should read it.','Man has gone out to explore other worlds and other civilizations without having explored his own labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers, and without finding what lies behind doorways that he himself has sealed.\r\n\r\n- Stanislaw Lem, Solaris'),(9,4,9789536185344,'herasim','Classic piece of literature','This book was a pretty good read. Most of what is discussed are extremely valuable information. Although with only 5 years of experience I felt like many of the points that Steve brought up were fairly obvious once youve been working as a Software Developer. If you are new to programming, want to move to a more professional level of programming or just plain have plenty of time on your hands this is a great book. '),(10,5,9780826401076,'Neo','A frenetic, benzedrinical helter','Ok, so I dont want to give too much away here. This short book, almost a novella really, takes you on quite a ride, and I really enjoyed not knowing where it was going, so Im not going to say too much about the plot. But basically it starts in one dystopian future, where the main character is at a convention about solving the worlds many serious problems, and then it takes you to another, where all of those problems have been solved by technology - and pharmacology in particular. '),(11,5,9785865470595,'Neo','This is one of the best books ever!','The main theme of this book and one aptly identified in the title Hard to Be a God is how the advanced human beings from earth should react to the harsh human conditions that exist within the more primitive race of humans on the planet. Should they intercept with the knowledge and technology they have in order to better their condition? '),(12,5,9783518743423,'Neo','Horpach took off his coat.','ne of my favourite Lem novels, it possible worries me that it is one of those with the least amount of quirky strangeness and the most predictable plot arc. Two of my favourite quotes:\r\n\\n\\n\r\nMan -- he saw in a flash of insight -- had not yet reached the true pinnacle; he had not yet appropriated that galactocentric idea, praised since antiquity, whose real meaning could not consist in searching only for similar beings and learning to understand them, but rather in refraining from interfering with alien, non-human affairs. Conquer the void, of course; why not? but dont attack what already is, that which in the course of millions of years has achieved a balanced existence of its own, independent, not subject to anyone or anything, except the forces of radiation and matter -- an active existence, neither better nor worse than the existence of the amino-acid compounds we call animals or human beings (146).'),(13,5,9783518371701,'Pennywise','Hhahahahaha!','I am dancing, just dancing, you so scary!\r\nThe book is great, through.'),(15,5,9785170591916,'Neo','Awesome)','it was really nice to revisit one of my early sci-fi inspirations after some two decades. as expected, the perception was a lot more different and subtle on various levels. sometimes i wish i could do this more often with books id enjoyed or not quite. each time this might promise another meeting with Heraclitus giving me a different bouquet of tiny discoveries. and maybe a fellow-feeling hug.');
