Fay has gone back to primary documents: Shostakovichs many letters, concert programs and reviews, newspaper articles, and diaries of his contemporaries. An indefatigable worker, he wrote his arresting music despite deprivations during the Nazi invasion and constant surveillance under Stalins regime. Shostakovichs life is a fascinating example of the paradoxes of living as an artist under totalitarian rule. In August 1942, his Seventh Symphony, written as a protest against fascism, was performed in Nazi-besieged Leningrad by the citys surviving musicians, and was triumphantly broadcast to the German troops, who had been bombarded beforehand to silence them. Alone among his artistic peers, he survived successive Stalinist cultural purges and won the Stalin Prize five times, yet in 1948 he was dismissed from his conservatory teaching positions, and many of his works were banned from performance. He prudently censored himself, in one case putting aside a work based on Jewish folk poems. Under later regimes he balanced a career as a model Soviet, holding government positions and acting as an international ambassador with his unflagging artistic ambitions. In the years since his death in 1975, many have embraced a view of Shostakovich as a lifelong dissident who encoded anti-Communist messages in his music. This lucid and fascinating biography demonstrates that the reality was much more complex. Laurel Fays book includes a detailed list of works, a glossary of names, and an extensive bibliography, making it an indispensable resource for future studies of Shostakovich.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UbBAFDCmeEQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'),(199743797,'What Hath God Wrought',928,'he series includes three Pulitzer Prize winners, a New York Times bestseller, and winners of the Bancroft and Parkman Prizes.

The author suggests that from the Neolithic beginnings of grain agriculture to the present major social changes in all parts of the world were triggered by new or newly important foreign stimuli, and he presents a persuasive narrative of world history to support this claim. In a retrospective essay titled \"The Rise of the West after Twenty-five Years,\" McNeill shows how his book was shaped by the time and place in which it was written (1954-63). He discusses how historiography subsequently developed and suggests how his portrait of the worlds past in The Rise of the West should be revised to reflect these changes. \"This is not only the most learned and the most intelligent, it is also the most stimulating and fascinating book that has ever set out to recount and explain the whole history of mankind. . . .

Using a vast record of original documents and personal narratives, Douglas A.

Gone is the image of the sternly puritanical Confucian as sole representative of Chinese sexual practices—and with it the justification for the modern Chinese insistence that homosexuality is a recent import from the decadent West. Rediscovering the male homosexual tradition in China provides a startling new perspective on Chinese society and adds richly to our understanding of homosexuality. Bret Hinschs reconstruction of the Chinese homosexual past reveals unexpected scenes. An emperor on his deathbed turns over the seals of the empire to a male beloved; two men marry each other with elaborate wedding rituals; parents sell their son into prostitution. The tradition portrays men from all levels of society—emperors, transvestite actors, rapists, elegant scholars, licentious monks, and even the nameless poor. Drawing from dynastic histories, erotic novels, popular Buddhist tracts, love poetry, legal cases, and joke books, Passions of the Cut Sleeve evokes the complex and fascinating male homosexual tradition in China from the Bronze Age until its decline in recent times.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1LmEC1b1bncC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'),(521349931,'Machiavelli: The Prince',152,'In his introduction to this new translation by Russell Price, Professor Skinner presents a lucid analysis of Machiavellis text as a response both to the world of Florentine politics, and as an attack on the advice-books for princes published by a number of his contemporaries.

Most Americans, black and white, have a singular vision of slavery, one fixed in the mid-nineteenth century when most American slaves grew cotton, resided in the deep South, and subscribed to Christianity. Here, however, Berlin offers a dynamic vision, a major reinterpretation in which slaves and their owners continually renegotiated the terms of captivity. Slavery was thus made and remade by successive generations of Africans and African Americans who lived through settlement and adaptation, plantation life, economic transformations, revolution, forced migration, war, and ultimately, emancipation. Berlins understanding of the processes that continually transformed the lives of slaves makes \"Generations of Captivity\" essential reading for anyone interested in the evolution of antebellum America. Connecting the \"Charter Generation\" to the development of Atlantic society in the seventeenth century, the \"Plantation Generation\" to the reconstruction of colonial society in the eighteenth century, the \"Revolutionary Generation\" to the Age of Revolutions, and the \"Migration Generation\" to American expansionism in the nineteenth century, Berlin integrates the history of slavery into the larger story of American life. He demonstrates how enslaved black people, by adapting to changing circumstances, prepared for the moment when they could seize liberty and declare themselves the \"Freedom Generation.\" This epic story, told by a master historian, provides a rich understanding of the experience of African-American slaves, an experience that continues to mobilize American thought and passions today.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=WrzmkXfcc3wC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'),(674026764,'A SECULAR AGE',874,'Presents an analysis of secularism in the modern age.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=hWRXYY3HRFoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'),(674131789,'rance and Germany',270,'We live in a world bounded and defined by the legal institution of citizenship.

In order to understand the Bible, we need a missional hermeneutic of the Bible, an interpretive perspective that is in tune with this great missional theme. We need to see the \"big picture\" of Gods mission and how the familiar bits and pieces fit into the grand narrative of Scripture. Beginning with the Old Testament and the groundwork it lays for understanding who God is, what he has called his people to be and do, and how the nations fit into Gods mission, Wright gives us a new hermeneutical perspective on Scripture. This new perspective provides a solid and expansive basis for holistic mission. Wright emphasizes throughout a holistic mission as the proper shape of Christian mission. Gods mission is to reclaim the world--and that includes the created order--and Gods people have a designated role to play in that mission.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=jKZmH6KA4wsC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'),(849355168,'tis B Virus',330,'Molecular Biology of the Hepatitis B Virus presents a comprehensive account of the various molecular aspects of the life cycle of the hepatitis B virus (HBV).

But when Moira Weigel dives into the history of sex and romance in modern America, she discovers that authorities have always said this. Ever since young men and women started to go out together, older generations have scolded them: That’s not the way to find true love. The first women who made dates with strangers were often arrested for prostitution; long before “hookup culture,” there were “petting parties”; before parents worried about cell phone apps, they fretted about joyrides and “parking.” Dating is always dying. But this does not mean that love is dead. It simply changes with the economy. Dating is, and always has been, tied to work. Lines like “I’ll pick you up at six” made sense at a time when people had jobs that started and ended at fixed hours. But in an age of contract work and flextime, many of us have become sexual freelancers, more likely to text a partner “u still up?” Weaving together over one hundred years of history with scenes from the contemporary landscape, Labor of Love offers a fresh feminist perspective on how we came to date the ways we do. This isnt a guide to “getting the guy.” There are no ridiculous “rules” to follow. Instead, Weigel helps us understand how looking for love shapes who we are—and hopefully leads us closer to the happy ending that dating promises.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nqTPCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'),(9780387774510,'nformation',496,'The second edition of Dr. Demski’s book reflects his experiences teaching undergraduates, masters and doctoral students.

When she arrives at the famed Barbizon Hotel in 1952, secretarial school enrollment in hand, Darby McLaughlin is everything her modeling agency hall mates arent: plain, self-conscious, homesick, and utterly convinced she doesnt belong—a notion the models do nothing to disabuse. Yet when Darby befriends Esme, a Barbizon maid, shes introduced to an entirely new side of New York City: seedy downtown jazz clubs where the music is as addictive as the heroin thats used there, the startling sounds of bebop, and even the possibility of romance. Over half a century later, the Barbizons gone condo and most of its long-ago guests are forgotten. But rumors of Darbys involvement in a deadly skirmish with a hotel maid back in 1952 haunt the halls of the building as surely as the melancholy music that floats from the elderly womans rent-controlled apartment. Its a combination too intoxicating for journalist Rose Lewin, Darbys upstairs neighbor, to resist—not to mention the perfect distraction from her own imploding personal life. Yet as Roses obsession deepens, the ethics of her investigation become increasingly murky, and neither woman will remain unchanged when the shocking truth is finally revealed.','http://books.google.com/books/content?id=JKRcCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api'),(9781137572516,'The Best of Business Economics',480,'Since its establishment in 1965, Business Economics has been an essential resource for those who use economics in the workplace.

Marwick recaptures the events and movements that shaped life as we know it: the rise of a youth subculture across the West; the sit-ins and marches of the civil rights movement; Britains surprising rise to leadership in fashion and music; the emerging storm over Vietnam; the Paris student uprising of 1968; the growing force of feminism, and much more.

The skies were clear that Friday, October 13, 1972, and at 3:30 p.m., the Fairchild’s pilot reported their altitude at 15,000 feet. But one minute later, the Santiago control tower lost all contact with the aircraft. For eight days, Chileans, Uruguayans, and Argentinians searched for it, but snowfall in the Andes had been heavy, and the odds of locating any wreckage were slim. Ten weeks later, a Chilean peasant in a remote valley noticed two haggard men desperately gesticulating to him from across a river. He threw them a pen and paper, and the note they tossed back read: “I come from a plane that fell in the mountains . . .” Sixteen of the original forty-five passengers on the F-227 survived its horrific crash. In the remote glacial wilderness, they camped in the plane’s fuselage, where they faced freezing temperatures, life-threatening injuries, an avalanche, and imminent starvation.

On the other side sit the halflings, proudly astride their war alpacas, carrying bags of grenades and hungry for a fight. And pretty much anything else. It takes only one halfling bomb and Offi Numminen’s world is turned upside down—or downside up, really, since he lives in a hole in the ground. His goth cardigans and aggressive melancholy set him apart from the other gnomes, as does his decision to fight back against their halfling oppressors. Suddenly Offi is the leader of a band of lovable misfits and outcasts—from a gryphon who would literally kill for omelets to a young dwarf herbalist who is better with bees than with his cudgel to an assertive and cheerful teen witch with a beard as long as her book of curses—all on a journey to the Toot Towers to confront the dastardly villain intent on tearing Pell asunder.
